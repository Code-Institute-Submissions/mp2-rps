## Potential Future Development for the Website

In future developments I would like to add more Easter eggs like Dragon mode where all player options are dragons and they beat everything or Hard Mode where none of the buttons have any text and all the user icons appear to be hidden under a blanket. 

Asside from silly features that don't really add to the gameplay I would like to add a High scores section that would require the inputting of a username either on page load on the welcome screen or after a Game Over message that could appear after a timer had run out.

## What I would have done differently 

Given the oppurtunity to start over I would do two things differently. First of all I would stick to my code plan more closely. I spent a lot of time going round in circles when the answer was often in front of me on paper the whole time. 
Secondly I would focus on the mobile design and resposiveness and scale it up to suit large screens rather than the opposite. I got far too caught up in (quite literally) the big picture.

## Credits

### Content

With the exception of the code mentioned below, all code was written by myself having drawn inspiration from a variety of sources including but not limited to:
* Code Instiitute
* W3schools
* CodeCademy
* Web Dev Simplified Youtube channel 

### Code

The piece of code that I drew particularly heavily from was from the following article:
https://gomakethings.com/how-to-create-a-konami-code-easter-egg-with-vanilla-js/#:~:text=The%20Konami%20Code%20is%20Up,would%20give%20you%2030%20lives

I used this code to implement the Konami code easter egg found when (on a desktop) you type out the Konami code mentioned previously. 

### Media

The icons and backgorund image were taken from Pexels.com and the Konami code icon variants were created using the Dall.e 2 ai using various generator prompts such as “an angry, fighting anthropomorphic pair of scissors, anime”. 


### Personal 

As always credit must be given to my Wife for her continuing support, understanding and encouragement; forcing me to always aim higher.
